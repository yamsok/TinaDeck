A front-end override suite for TweetDeck

A collection of CSS and JS files to makes TweetDeck look how it supposed to be.

#### What am I calling a "front-end" override ?
*Front-end web developement* defines every part of a code in a web page that is loaded on the client-side. Basically, it will be the content of the page, the styles applied on it and the scripts (like animations, etc)
